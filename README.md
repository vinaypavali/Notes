# Notes
### Question the existence of a topic, not just its definition — understand why it exists, what problem it solves, and when it becomes necessary.

Definition & Purpose

What is this?

Why does it exist?

What problem does it solve?

Scope & Limitations

Where can it be used?

What inputs/outputs are expected?

What are the constraints?

Connections

Does it relate to something I already know?

Can it interact with other elements/modules/classes?

Alternatives

Are there other ways to solve the same problem?

What’s the difference in behavior/performance?
